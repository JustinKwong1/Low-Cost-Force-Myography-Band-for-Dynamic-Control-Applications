# Low-Cost-Force-Myography-Band-for-Dynamic-Control-Applications
We aim to create an open sourced, low-cost FMG wearable device combining portability, wireless functionality, and real-time classification.

Current force myography bands are tethered to bulky wires, cables, and external (and expensive) measurement devices, making clinical and everyday uses impractical. This open sourced low-cost band allows for an untethered, mobile, and comfortable design. 

Attached to this repository, you can find the associated code, 3D CAD models, and instructions to build your own FMG band.
